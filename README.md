# Road-Accident-Analysis


In this project, we're building a Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022. It's like a tool that helps us understand road accidents better. We want to know things like how many accidents happened, how bad they were, and where they happened.

The dashboard will show us the total number of accidents and people hurt or worse for this year and compare it to last year. We'll also see if accidents were more severe or not. We'll even break down the numbers by the type of vehicles involved.

Additionally, we'll look at the data month by month to see if there are any patterns. We'll also find out which types of roads are riskier. And, we'll check if accidents are more common during the day or at night.

Finally, we'll see which areas have the most accidents. This project is all about using simple data to make our roads safer.

### The requirements are as follows-

+ Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY
 
+ Primary KPI - Total Casualties by Accident severity for the current Year and YoY

+ Secondary KPI - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for Current Year

+ Monthly trend showing the comparison of casualties for the Current and Previous Year

+ Casualties by Road Type for the Current Year

+ Current Year Casualties by Area/Location and by Day/Night

+ Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location


### The flow of the respective project is-

+  Requirement gathering

+  Stakeholders in the project

+  Raw data overview

+  Connecting data with Power BI

+  Data cleaning

+  Data processing

+  Data Modelling

+  Data visualization

+  Dashboard building and Insights



### Stakeholders in the project

+ Ministry of Transport

+ Road and Transport Department

+ Police Force

+ Emergency Services Department

+ Road Safety Corps

+ Transport Operators

+ Traffic Management Agencies

+ Public

+ Media



### We will be using the Business Intelligence Tool "Microsoft Power BI" to visualize the data. Below are some functionalities of Power BI we will be dealing with-

+ Connecting raw data

+ Data Processing

+ Time intelligence function/ Calender Date table in Power BI

+ Data Modelling(Relationship between multiple tables)

+ YTD and YoY growth calculations using DAX

+ KPI and Advanced KPI generations

+ Creating custom columns and measures in the reports

+ Importing images

+ Creating different charts and generating
