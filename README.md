# Road-Accident-Analysis


"In this project, we're building a Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022. It's like a tool that helps us understand road accidents better. We want to know things like how many accidents happened, how bad they were, and where they happened.

The dashboard will show us the total number of accidents and people hurt or worse for this year and compare it to last year. We'll also see if accidents were more severe or not. We'll even break down the numbers by the type of vehicles involved.

Additionally, we'll look at the data month by month to see if there are any patterns. We'll also find out which types of roads are riskier. And, we'll check if accidents are more common during the day or at night.

Finally, we'll see which areas have the most accidents. This project is all about using simple data to make our roads safer."

### The requirements are as follows-

_1. Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY

2. Primary KPI - TOtal Casualties by Accident severity for the current Year and YoY

3. Secondary KPI - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for Current Year

4. Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current and Previous Year

5. Casualties by Road Type for the Current Year

6. Current Year Casualties by Area/Location and by Day/Night

7. Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location
